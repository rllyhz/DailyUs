This project was part of submission projects to finish the Dicoding Indonesia's Android Intermediate
course. The main purpose of this submission was to challenge students to create a
posting-stories-like Android app. The app being built had to be using Animation (ex. Property
Animation, Motion Animation, or Shared Element), Authentication (Login and Register), posting a new
story with photo and description, show story list, and creating a custom view.
